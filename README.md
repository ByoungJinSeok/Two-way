# Two-way based implementation 

This repository presents our implementation result of block ciphers including SPARX-64/128, CHAM-64/128.

In our repository, you can download the original version and the revised version (based on two-way implementation).

The source codes are the project file of CCS (Code Composer Studio) and were written for a specific board (LAUNCHXL-CC2640R2 made by Texas Instruments).

For excuting the source code,

1. Prepare the target board (LAUNCHXL-CC2640R2, Available: http://www.ti.com/tool/LAUNCHXL-CC2640R2?keyMatch=cc2640r2f&tisearch=Search-EN-Everything).

2. Download CCS and setup in your PC (Code Composer Studio, Available: http://software-dl.ti.com/ccs/esd/documents/ccs_downloads.html).

3. Clone our project.

4. Launch our project in CCS.

5. Connect the board to PC.

6. Build the project and excute the debug mode.
   - Build "tirtos_builds_CC2640R2_LAUNCHXL_release_ccs".
   - Build "empty_CC2640R2_LAUNCHXL_tirtos_ccs".
   - Press "Run - Debug" on the menu.
